Foolsgold artist Brenmar needed a 3D scan of his bust in order to simulate a trophy in his likeness for the cover of his new album, Award.  

Having limited time to refine the process, we opted to use existing Skanect software to pair up well with the Microsoft Kinect for an easy, relatively stress-free session of live 3D scaning.

Afterwards, the scans were smoothed and refined in Cinema4D before the final rendering artist added texture, gloss, and environment.
