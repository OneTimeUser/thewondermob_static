Title: Hood By Air

----

Text: 

Hood By Air is a high fashion label created by Shayne Oliver, a New York City born and raised designer with an appreciated and welcomed perspective on streetwear and high fashion. 

With such expectations surrounding the designer, it seemed fitting that Wonder Mob would distill this unique energy into a shop launch-site worthy of their representation.

Haunting models lined the front page like an army of insurgents, ready to upend conventional notions of beauty and style.  

Simple and impactful in nature, the site launch saw sales increases in quadruple digit percentages.   

We'd like to take all the credit but it helps the product is g√ºd.
