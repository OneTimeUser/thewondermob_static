Title: Children's Museum of Manhattan

Text: 

This is a preview prototype of Inspired: Muslim Architecture, an immersive exploration of the art and architecture of mosques from around the world for the Children's Museum of Manhattan- part of a larger permanent exhibit to occupy some of the main floor of the premier space in upper Manhattan.  

This portable installation consists of a large projection-mapped pop-up book with screen and projector/tripod, controlled wirelessly by educators via an iPad. The pop-up book is made out of lightweight posterboard and air-blown plastic, with leather and wood finishes.  

Check out the videos below for a look into the process and the dynamic content used to get children excited about globally relevant architecture.
