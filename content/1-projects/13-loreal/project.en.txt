Title: L'Oréal

Text: 

For the launch of a new hair product, L’Oréal wanted an interactive gallery to showcase their new product through several hair tutorials. Using a custom gestural detection system, wondermob went about creating the interactivity for a user’s webcam to recognize hand gestures in order to control navigation from within the turotial; thus, users with products on their hands could follow along with the tutorial while his/her keyboard remained free of the sticky product.

Wondermob also created the adjoining microsite to feature the product, show product recommendations, and video collaboration with stylist Kelly Framel of theglamourai.com.
