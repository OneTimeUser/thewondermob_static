Rainbow Brush is a 3D drawing tool that allows you to create 3D illustrations and place it in the real world around you.

Select different geometry and colors while exploring effects such as the symmetry and the squiggle tool to make those shapes come alive.

Share your creations with your friends by hitting the record button and let your inner rainbow flow.

Have fun.
Color the world.
And when in doubt, rainbow brush.
