When Mtv and Intel came together to start the Iggy project, it was under the auspice and theme of "experiment."  As such, each event had to have something spectacular, memorable, and utterly jaw-dropping to impress the lucky and discerning concertgoers who'd be in attendance.

We were fortunate enough to take part in the conceiving, building, and programming of this gigantic 50’ dance cube with interactive, cube-centric graphics that included algorithmic patterns, sound-activation, and of course, the obligatory live social-feed.  

We transformed an airplane hangar into a gothic, neon-themed, electronic dance party and played music for hundreds including some of Hollywood’s hottest stars. Guests got the chance to experience Intel activations throughout the venue and party over the course of the night.
