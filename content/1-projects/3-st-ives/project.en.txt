Title: St. Ives

Text: 

St. Ives wanted to jump on the pop-up retail experience and chose NYC as the place to do it. The Wonder Mob consulted with St. Ives on ideating and creating this pop-up store concept that allowed the brand's fans and the curious alike to come in and create their own custom concoctions of famous St. Ives products like scrubs and lotions, all within a wellness-centric environment. These bespoke products were then branded and named accordingly, allowing the participant to take home this prized collaboration.
